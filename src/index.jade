      p Univariate linear regression is a tool to predict probable future outcomes given a set of information about past occurences. "Univariate" just means "having one variable".
      p In our graph above, "x" and "y" could represent anything. As an example, let's say "x" represents the population size of a city, and "y" represents the profits a food truck company makes in that city.
      p Each point on the graph represents a city with a population size of "x" and profits of "y" dollars.
      p If there is a linear correlation ("linear" simply meaning "shaped like a straight line") between population and profits, then we will be able to find a line that fits between these data points in such a way that it represents a trend.

      p Looking at the the graph above, we can see that, in general, for cities with larger populations, the profits made in those cities tends to be larger. The blue line expresses this trend in a useful way. By casting the trend in abstract form as a function, we can use the trend to predict probable future outcomes.
